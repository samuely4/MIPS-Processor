# This is a MIPS assembly code to produce Fibonacci Series: F(n)=F(n-2)+F(n-1)
# i.e. F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, ...
# Generate at least the first two numbers, continue until we reach a predefined index number  
# The output are written into the data segment of the system memory
# The use of registers:
# $t0: output memory address
# $t1: F(n-2)
# $t2: F(n-1)
# $t3: F(n)
# $t4: loop index 
# $t5: total number of Fibonacci number to be produced (>=2)

main:	
	# initialize all registers
	la $t0, memory # pointer to the memeory address for writing
	# the memory address can also be passed to $t0 using, for example, 
	# li $t0, 0x10010000 or
	# addiu $t0, $zero, 0x10010000
	li $t1, 1 # initialize $t1
