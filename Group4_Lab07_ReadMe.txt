Notes: 
1- In the project file uploaded to blackboard, I have written
two MIPS assembly programs to test LW and Jump instrcutions.

-----The original file taken from the instructor is called 
-----Fibonacci.asm/Fibonacci.bin

-----the second program that tests LW instruction is called
-----Fibonacci2.asm/Fibonacci2.bin

-----the third program that tests Jump instrcution is called
-----Fibonacci3.asm/Fibonacci3.bin

------------all six files do exist in the directory of the 
------------project file uploaded to blackboard.
------------if the grader wants to test those two instrcutions
------------mentioned above, the grader has to change the name
------------of the file in the ROM module.

thanks
